Artistry

Smith cites Adele and Amy Winehouse as his main influences.[34][35] He further lists Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Beyoncé, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey as influences. Sam said about a diva quality to his voice:

"It's all I listened to. I actually didn't listen to male vocalists until about two years ago. I just listened to Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan. Massive voices."[36]


Personal life

In May 2014, Smith revealed to the public that he is gay. He acknowledged a relationship—since ended—with actor and model Jonathan Zeizel.[37][38] At the Grammy Awards ceremony on February 8, 2015, where he won four categories, including best new artist and best pop vocal album, he said, "I would like to thank the man that this album is about. By breaking my heart, you won me four Grammys!"[39]

In an interview with 4Music, Smith discussed his struggles with obsessive–compulsive disorder. "I actually have OCD really bad, and it's getting a bit worse at the moment", he said. "I have to check taps... before I leave the house, to make sure I've checked everything in case it floods."[40] He is a third-cousin of singer Lily Allen and actor Alfie Allen.[41]
