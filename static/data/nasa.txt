The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the United States government agency that is responsible for the civilian space program as well as for aeronautics and aerospace research.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics <TIMEX2 VAL="1958">1958</TIMEX2> and Space Administration (NASA) in <TIMEX2 VAL="1958">1958</TIMEX2>[5] with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on <TIMEX2 VAL="19580729">July 29, 1958</TIMEX2>, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on <TIMEX2 VAL="19581001">October 1, 1958</TIMEX2>.[6][7]
Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.
NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System,[8] advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program,[9] exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic missions such as New Horizons,[10] and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.[11] NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.

The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late <TIMEX2 VAL="1970s">1970s</TIMEX2> and the <TIMEX2 VAL="1980s">1980s</TIMEX2>. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by <TIMEX2 VAL="1985">1985</TIMEX2>. The first to launch, Columbia, did so on <TIMEX2 VAL="19810412">April 12, 1981</TIMEX2>,[49] the 20th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin.[50]
Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185_643 km (115_400 miles)[51] and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000 lb).[52] Missions could last from 5 to <TIMEX2 VAL="P17D">17 days</TIMEX2> and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.[51]
On 20 missions (1983_98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.[53] Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in <TIMEX2 VAL="1990">1990</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 VAL="1993">1993</TIMEX2>, respectively.[54]
In <TIMEX2 VAL="1995">1995</TIMEX2>, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle-Mir missions (1995_1998). <TIMEX2 VAL="PAST_REF">Once</TIMEX2> more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters: Challenger in <TIMEX2 VAL="1986">1986</TIMEX2>, and Columbia in <TIMEX2 VAL="2003">2003</TIMEX2>.[55] While the <TIMEX2 VAL="1986">1986</TIMEX2> loss was mitigated by building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.[55] NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on <TIMEX2 VAL="20110721">July 21, 2011</TIMEX2>. The program spanned <TIMEX2 VAL="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX2> with over 300 astronauts sent into space.[56]
